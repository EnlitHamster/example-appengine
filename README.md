# App Engine Flask App

This app is part of my experiments with OpenTofu and GCP to provision an App Engine stack based on a GitHub repo, with a CI/CD pipeline that includes Cloud Build, and data stored in Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL, complete with logging and monitoring.

The app itself was based on [Flask-Examples](https://github.com/helloflask/flask-examples/)
